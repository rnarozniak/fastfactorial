This is C++ port (with some changes) of Peter Luschny's fast factorial implementation.
Please, visit http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/FastFactorialFunctions.htm for more details.

Here you can find C++ port of PrimeSwing and ParallelPrimeSwing algorithms, which are the fastest
according to benchmarks http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/Benchmark.html

C++ port is based on GMP libarary http://gmplib.org/
